My Personal Programmer is a code-free Windows development
tool designed for application development including teaching 
new developers basic programming logic and event-driven 
learning. Making this tool available on GitHub to help
programmers and non-programmers write applications quickly
while learning End-User computing techniques without 
spending extra time learning a specific programming language. 
This tool incorporates already developed engines inside
Microsoft Windows, and extends with external console 
applications such as .NET, Python, C/C++, C#, VB, or other 
languages that can create console applications.
